    <h2>🎯 Which version to choose?</h2>

    <p>This software comes in an installable version and a portable version. There is no functional difference between the 2 versions.</p>

    <h3>Why is the portable version recommended?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>In general:</strong> Faced with the risk of hacking, the computer will remain free of sensitive data concerning your passwords.</li>

      <li><strong>At the family level:</strong> Often there is only one Microsoft account (created when purchasing the computer). With the portable version, each family member can have their own version on a personal USB drive, thus making the other's passwords inaccessible. Your teen won't have access to the dating site you visit on the sly! (Sorry, I never did that!)</li>

      <li><strong>At the SME office level:</strong> Each user will have independent access.</li>

      <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> You can take your passwords with you everywhere, on a USB drive or an external hard drive. Convenient if you use multiple computers (home, work, etc.).</li>

      <li><strong>Small drawback:</strong> You must not forget your USB drive and it is recommended to have a carefully stored copy.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>⚠️ Important reminder:</strong> CréaPass leaves no trace on your computer!

    <h2>💻 Why choose the installable version?</h2>

    <h3>Advantages of the installable version</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ease of use:</strong> No USB drive to carry around, no risk of forgetting or losing it. Your passwords are always accessible as soon as you turn on your computer.</li>

        <li><strong>For exclusive personal use:</strong> If you are the only user of your computer and no one else has access to it, the installable version is the most convenient for daily use.</li>

        <li><strong>Ideal for a professional computer:</strong> On a personal workstation in a company, where only you have access to your Windows session, local installation simplifies usage.</li>

        <li><strong>Optimal performance:</strong> Data access is slightly faster from the computer's hard drive than from a USB drive.</li>

        <li><strong>Small drawback:</strong> If multiple people use the same computer, they may potentially have access to your passwords (unless you protect your Windows session with a password).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="important">
        <strong>💡 Tip:</strong> The installable version is perfect if you control access to your computer!
