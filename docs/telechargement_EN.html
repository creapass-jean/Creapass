    <h2>🎯 Which version to choose?</h2>

    <p>This software comes in an installable version and a portable version. There is no functional difference between the 2 versions.</p>

    <h3>Why is the portable version recommended?</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>At the family level:</strong> Often there is only one Microsoft account (created when purchasing the computer). With the portable version, each family member can have their own version on a personal USB drive, thus making the other's passwords inaccessible. Your teen won't have access to the dating site you visit on the sly! (Sorry, I never did that!)</li>

      <li><strong>At the SME office level:</strong> Each user will have independent access.</li>

      <li><strong>In general:</strong> Faced with the risk of hacking, the computer will remain free of sensitive data concerning your passwords.</li>
      <li><strong>Small drawback:</strong> You must not forget your USB drive and it is recommended to have a carefully stored copy.</li>
    </ul>

      <strong>⚠️ Important reminder:</strong> CréaPass leaves no trace on your computer!
